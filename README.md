# temperatureTracker
displays current temperatures and past temperatures

/////////////////////////////////////////////////
An interactive weather app that at a given location(latitude and longitude) will give the average temperature of the current year (so far) along with the average temp for the year 5 years in the past, 10 years in the past, and 20 years in the past. I can use the openWeatherMap Api to get this information. I want to focus more setting up the website than managing the data. I think I should focus more on the front end coding because that is where im most uncomfortable and probably have more to learn. The “website” will be coded in HTML (for structure) and CSS(for styling) for the most part im thinking very simple design and javaScript for basic user interaction like getting location and passing it and getting the data from the backend and giving information. The “backend” is going to be minimal because I dont want to store the information, just pass it through. Im thinking just a program that makes a request to the Api and passes it to the website, this will have the Api key (I have to look into how to set this up).
