# temperatureTracker
displays current temperatures and past temperatures


Website that generates temperature comparison for any location across different time periods. When given a city, province or country current temperature data is compared to temperatures from 5 years ago, 10 years ago, and 15 years ago. Cities generally provide more specific responses because when given a province or country the temperatures are averaged. This allows for the changing temperatures to be seen in a concice way. Global warming is a real problem however people continue to deny it because the changes are drastice but they happen over a long time so the effects seem to be minute. This program will allow people to see that these small changes compound and the effects are getting to a point of no return.
